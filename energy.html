  <h1>Improvements Made </h1>
  <h2> Despite the increase in the urgency of climate change issues, improvements have been made. As shown in the two maps below, the amount of Nitrogen Dioxide has decreased from 2000 to 2016 due to the different types of renewable energy recources that have been used over the years.</h2>

  <h1> Solar Power:</h1>
   <h2> -Wind energy uses the wind as a natural source of power to spin the turbines that turn and generate energy. It's best feature is that its a clean fuel source that doesn't pollute the earth.

  <h1> Wind Power:</h1>
    <h2>  -Solar power another clean fuel source that uses the sun's light to generate electricity and save you money compared to other options. It's also more for individual use, they go on top of homes and create power for that specific home only.

  <h1> Hydroelectric Power: </h1>
      <h2>  -Hydroelectric power is a very common energy source used is various places due to the availability of water and uses hydroelectric power plants to run water through, spinning a turbine that generates electricity.</h2>

   <h1> Biomass Energy:</h1>
    <h2>  -Biomass energy is organic material collected from plants and animals. The energy absorbed from the
Sun that's collected by plants or animals is what's used to generate the power.
