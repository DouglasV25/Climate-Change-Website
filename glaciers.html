  <h1>Melting Glaciers:</h1>
  
  <h2>  -Because of global warming, glaciers are melting rapidly. Glaciers in Western North America-not including Alaska-have lost about 117 billion tons of ice since 2000; they are currently losing about 12 billion tons a year. Humans burning fossil fuels is also expected to continue to melt alpine glaciers, and with shrinking glaciers, less water will be available for nearby river systems when rainfall is low. Millions of people could lose their primary water supplies around the world. </h2>

  <h2>The Arctic Circle, a region with a large amount of ice glaciers, has reached what scientists call, a tipping point. If this tipping point continues, scientists have expected to see a rise in sea-level within the next two decades. The Arctic Circle has lost about 400 billion tons of the ice within the year of 2012. If this much amount of ice keeps in being lost, it is expected that sea-levels will approximately rise 2 feet which will lead to an estimated number of 32-80 million people being exposed to coastal flooding. Rising sea-level also happens to one of the most clearest consequences of global warming.<h2>
