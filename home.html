  <h2>2015 Paris Agreement made sure that all global temperature stayed below 2 degrees celsius. This agreement was created to try and slow down the process of the fast moving change in the climate. This also allowed all countries (underrepresented and represented) to be able to deal with the impact of climate change and to be able to reach many goals that have deemed to obtainable. It also allowed parties from varied countries to be actively involved in the change of climate that was and could be happening in present and future, and to able to secure possible precautions that could be taken to slow down the process of such sudden change.</h2>


  <h2>The global surface temperature in 2018 was the fourth warmest since 1880. According to NASA, the temperature increased in from 1980 to 2018 1.5 degrees Celsius. On an average, the temperature increased by 2 degrees Celsius. Due to these sudden increase in temperature, there has been a large growth in ice loss around the world. Places like China, Greenland, Arctic Region and Antarctica have been greatly affected by the change in climate.</h2>
