  <h1> Changes In Climate: </h1>
  <h2>  -As the world has warmed, that warming has triggered many other changes to the Earth's climate. Changes in extreme weather and climate events, such as heat waves and droughts, are the primary way that most people experience climate change. Human-induced climate change has already increased the number and strength of some of these extreme events. Over the last 50 years, much of the U.S. has seen increases in high temperatures, heavy downpours, and in some regions, severe floods and droughts.
