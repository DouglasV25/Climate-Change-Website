  <h2>Survey Data:
       - This a survey we had students both in and outside of school and mentors take so we can get an idea of how informed the community around us is about climate change. Through this data set, we discovered that over 60% of those who participated do not actively choose to use renewble energy sources and that over 80% are not very well aware of where their energy is coming from. Though many where not in agreement with the idea of changing completely to renewable energy. We also discovered that people are not very informed even about the dangers of recources such as fossil fuel, as over 50% stated that they were not very aware of such consequences.</h2>
  <h2>
    Such statistics brought us to the conclusion that although people are aware of the general fact of global warming being dangerous, they are not very informed of the specific ways it is effecting our world and the things they can do to help decrease the damage. So we cme up with the idea of creating a website that can help the people in our communities to learn about how our world is changing through simpler forms of communication, such as visual graphics and data as well as giving them access to other resources that focus on such subject matters. </h2>
